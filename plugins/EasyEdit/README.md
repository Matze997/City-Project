## Patterns

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/platz1de/EasyEdit/wiki/Patterns) for information on patterns.

All variants of bedrock and java states are supported.

## Schematics

To load external schematic files, place them in the "schematics" folder inside the EasyEdit plugin data folder. <br>
Just execute `//load <schematicName>` to load them and then use `//paste` to paste them. Omitting the name (`//load`) will list all available schematics.

To save a schematic, use `//save` <schematicName>. This will save the current clipboard (which was previous copied using `//copy`) to the schematics folder.

Schematics are fully compatible with the java edition. When loading or saving a schematic, the file will be automatically converted to the java format.<br>
This includes blocks and tile entities.

Supported Formats:
- Sponge
- McEdit (reading only)

## Performance

EasyEdit aims to be as fast as possible while still allowing for a ton of features. <br>
All operations are executed asynchronously, meaning that the server will not lag while editing. You can always check the status of the current operation using `//status`.

Other world editors usually load the entirety of the selection into memory, which makes your server run out of memory very quickly. <br>
EasyEdit counteracts this by loading chunks on the fly, only loading the blocks that are actually being edited at the moment. <br>
This means that you can edit huge areas without having to worry about your server crashing. There is practically no limit to how many blocks you can edit at once.
